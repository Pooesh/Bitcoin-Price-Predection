# Bitcoin-Price-Predection
Cryptocurrency markets, particularly Bitcoin, exhibit high volatility, making them challenging to predict. This project employs machine learning techniques to forecast Bitcoin prices, leveraging historical data and various predictive feature
# Bitcoin Price Prediction using Machine Learning

Predicting Bitcoin prices with machine learning models. in the bitcoin prize prediction using the machine learning models like linear regression and decision tree and other models are compare to get the more accuracy in the accuracy based on the past historiacal data and we also implemented in the LSTM in the project because time series.

## Overview

This project aims to forecast Bitcoin prices by employing various machine learning algorithms. Historical price data and relevant features are used to train the models, and the performance is evaluated based on their ability to make accurate predictions.Based and the project is used till the year in the project mainly on the particular day high price and low price.
